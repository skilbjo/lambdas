### what
Using the docker-in-lambda work (the ultimate in functions-as-a-service, serverless computing, and virtualization and containerization), get a container running and sending an email on how my portfolio is doing for the day. Dependency on markets-etl and treats AWS Athena as its database.

Lots of interesting work done here, not just on the infrastructure side, but also writing a bash wrapper to treat the aws cli like a psql client: <https://github.com/skilbjo/iris/blob/master/src/athena>

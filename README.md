### lambdas

#### markets-etl
Get the latest markets data, write results to S3.

#### aws-anarchy
Perform management operations on AWS, such as shuffle data around S3, and keeping
AWS Athena partitions up to date.

#### bash-it
The AWS runtime doesn't support bash. However, bash is one of my favorite languages,
and is portable acrosss \*nix systems. Surely there is a way to break out of the
container AWS Lambda confines you to?

Nominally, uses a python runtime. But that's just an overhead wrapper before we
drop down into the good stuff.

#### dython
Docker in AWS Lambda.
